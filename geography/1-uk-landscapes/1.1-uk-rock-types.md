# UK Rock Types

The UK is made up of many different types of rocks.

## Main rock types

- Sedimentary
- Metamorphic
- Igneous

## Sedimentary rock

- Formed in **beds** (layers).
- Often contain fossils.

## Examples of sedimentary rock

- **Chalk**
    - Made of calcium carbonate.
    - At risk from chemical weathering.
- **Sandstone**
    - Made of sand-sized grains joined together.
    - Hard and resistant to weathering.
    - Permeable.

## Metamorphic rock

- Formed when other rock types are put under intense heat and pressure.
- Hard and resistant.
- Formed at plate boundaries.

## Examples of metamorphic rock

- **Schist**
    - Made up of thin layers of interlocking crystals.
    - Harder than slate.
- **Slate**
    - Hard and brittle.
    - Formed from a mixture of shale, clay and ash.

## Igneous rock

- Hard and resistant to erosiion.
- Made up of crystals.
- Often impermeable.

## Examples of igneous rock

- **Granite**
    - Susceptible to chemical weathering.
    - Granite landscapes drain badly.
        - This often results in boddy landscapes
- **Basalt**
    - Made up of tiny crystals.
    - Formed when lava flows cool.

## UK distribution of rock types

- The majority of the UK is made of **sedimentary rock**.
- Metamorphic rock can be found in the *north-west*.
- Igneous rock is distributed in small 'patches' across the UK.
